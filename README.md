Project: Interstellar Data Analysis & Visualization in Power BI

This project leverages Power BI’s data modeling and visualization capabilities to explore the complex themes of time, space, and gravity from the movie Interstellar. Using custom-built datasets, I performed in-depth analysis on various scientific and narrative aspects of the film, showcasing Power BI’s ability to transform complex data into compelling visual stories.

Key Technical Components:

Data Modeling: Created and transformed datasets representing time dilation, character ages, planet distances, and gravity’s effect on time. Built relationships between tables to analyze multiple dimensions of the movie's plot.

Visualizations: Designed a wide range of visuals, including:

Line and Bar Charts for depicting crop decline on Earth and population growth vs. food shortages.
Matrix & Timeline Visuals to illustrate time dilation effects, age comparisons between Cooper, Murph, and Brand, and how these events diverge on different planets.
3D Visualizations: Represented the Tesseract episode using a 3D cube to show Cooper’s interactions with different timelines.
Heat Maps & Cause-Effect Trees: Showed emotional intensity during key moments and the ripple effects of Cooper’s actions in the Tesseract.
Advanced Analytics: Implemented custom calculations for time-based effects using DAX, representing relativity’s influence on aging across different planets and gravitational forces.

Outcome: The project successfully illustrated how Power BI can tell a complex, multi-dimensional story using data. The final report included interactive dashboards allowing users to explore Interstellar's key moments and scientific concepts dynamically.
